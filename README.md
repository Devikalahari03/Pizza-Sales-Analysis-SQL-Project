# Objective 
The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to identify trends and provide actionable insights that can help to increase sales and aim to uncover key metrics and patterns 
within the sales data by leveraging SQL queries in MySQL.

# Tools Used 
Database Management System: MySQLQuery 
Tool: MySQL Workbench 

# Methodology 
# Database Setup: 
Created a database named "pizzahut" and Imported tables (orders,pizzas, 
order_details, pizza_types) into the database.
# Data Exploration and Cleaning: 
Explored the structure and contents of each table to understand the relationships and data points.Ensured data integrity by checking for null values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies. 
# Querying and Analysis: 
SQL queries were written to extract meaningful insights from the data. These queries addressed various aspects of pizza sales, including total orders, revenue generation, popular pizza types, and order distribution. 

# Overview 
In this project, addressed several critical questions related to pizza sales. These questions are organized under different categories to provide a structured analysis: 

# Sales Volume and Revenue 
Retrieve the total number of orders placed: 
Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales: 

# Product Analysis 
Identify the highest-priced pizza: 
Identify the most common pizza size ordered: 
List the 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities: 

# Category and Time Analysis 
Join the necessary tables and find the total quantity of each pizza categoryordered 
Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day 
Join the relevant tables and find the category-wise distribution of pizzas 

# Trend and Performance Analysis 
Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas orderedper day 
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue 
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenueAnalyze the 
cumulative revenue generated over time 
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizzacategory
